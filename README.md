# Machine Learning for Coders

## Getting Started
- Download 64-bit version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You will want Python 3.7 or newer.
- Within the root of this repository run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or, if you're using multiple versions of Python run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` .
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chrispresso/ML-for-coders.git`
- Launch jupyter notebook. If you have issues you can check the [docs](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html). Open a command prompt and type `jupyter notebook` , or if you have multiple versions of Python you can run `python3 -m notebook` .
- Navigate through the Jupyter Notebook UI to find the folder within the repository you just cloned and select the .ipynb that you wish to run. This should open the notebook in a new browser window. Although in a browser window, this is running locally on your machine now. Each "cell" within the notebook can be ran individuall by hitting `shift + enter`. The \[in\] cells consist of code to be ran, and the \[out\]  consist of the output after running the cell. If there's text in \[out\] then it means I've uploaded a notebook with my saved output to show you what you can expect. Be sure to still run the code within the \[in\].
